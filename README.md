Download the file and extract it. Open terminal from this folder.
Run python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-Vishaal/Kanna-Sivakumar.py
Enter the Start, Goal x and y coordinates (Input coordinates are refrenced as given in the map - origin at bottom-left).
Visualization is done after the map is explored and path is found.
The videos show the path generated for:
	1. Starting coordinates = (10, 10)
	   Goal coordinates = (250,150)
	2. Start coordinates = (100, 200)
	   Goal coordinates = (350, 50)
